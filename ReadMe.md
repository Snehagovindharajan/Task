I have worked on the function x power y and writtern the logic to find power of any positive or negative numbers.
I have writtern four test cases
    1) base and power are positive
    2) base is negative and power is positive
    3) base and power is negative
    4) base is positive and power is negative
    5) to check invalid input (i.e) When a string is given as input
Also attached a doc file "code_coverage and pep-8" which contains images of the report generated for the module
function_x_power_y and test_cases.py .
