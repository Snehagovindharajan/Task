I have worked on the function x power y and writtern the logic to find power of any positive or negative numbers.
I have writtern test cases to check when
    1) base and power are positive
    2) base is negative and power is positive
    3) base and power is negative
    4) base is positive and power is negative
    5) base is string and power is a number and vice versa
